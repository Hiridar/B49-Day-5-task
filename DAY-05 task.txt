DAY-05:
      1. For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for,for in,for of,forEach) ?

       (a) The ‘For’ Loop :
                       * The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity          and ease of use. It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. 
                       * The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’. Next, the terminal or final value is specified. The For Loop makes things really easy when you need to run a set of codes multiple times.  

      (b) The ‘For In’ Loop :
                       * Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free.    
                       * In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop. 
      (c) JSON Explained :
                       * If we go further in depth, there are a few more things you need to know about JSON.  The code that we just ran can also be expressed by including ‘[]’ to contain the above three nodes.

     2. Create your own resume data in JSON format ?
